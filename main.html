			<p>
				I am a composer with over ten years of experience in writing music. I was born in Cardiff and lived in Wales my whole life. 
				I am currently studying music composition at the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama.

			<h4 class="align-left">My Work</h4>
			<p>
				I have written for a wide range of instrumental groups from 
					<a href= "https://soundcloud.com/thomas-wheeler-150576347/on-the-ocean-at-sunset" target ="_blank">solo instruments</a> 
				to full orchestras. I also have experience in writing 
					<a href= "https://soundcloud.com/thomas-wheeler-150576347/electronic-drone-piece-v05" target ="_blank">electronic and ambient music</a>. 
				My main passion is in 
					<a href="https://soundcloud.com/thomas-wheeler-150576347/the-vixens-that-come-from-the-sea" target ="_blank">songwriting</a> 
				where I have developed skills in lyric writing. My work can mostly be found on Soundcloud but more platforms will be utilised in the future.
